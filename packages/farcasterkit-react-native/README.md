# farcasterkit-react-native

farcasterkit-react-native is a work in progress package that adds [farcaster kit](https://farcasterkit.com) support to react native

right now farcasterkit-react-native only contains a `NeynarProvider` (more coming soon), but the provider is still robust enough that it powers all read/write interactions for the mobile client [litecast](https://github.com/dylsteck/litecast)!

built by [dylsteck](https://github.com/dylsteck) and powered by [nexus](https://withcortex.com)
